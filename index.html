            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p> 
                It all started with a swipe... back in 2018 we both signed up for a dating app called Bumble, looking for love. 
                For Nono, it was Tamira's bucketlist (a few items like seeing the Northern lights are still on there!) that peaked his interest.

            <figure class="quote-block">                                    <!--Combining the required quote and required block in one go-->
                <blockquote>
                    "To this day, Tamira's sense of adventure means there's never a dull moment between us"
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption class=quote-block-caption>                      <!--wrapped the quote in a figure so I could use the "source" as a caption, got this idea from Bootstrap-->
                    -   Nono
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> 
                For Tamira, it was a photo of Nono laughing so hard his body and head were tilted backwards. Within a couple of weeks, we had arranged a first date at the theatre.
                In hindsight, this wasn't an ideal first meetup, because we couldn't chat much and kept stealing sideways glances at each other.
                We quickly arranged a second date, where we really hit it off. Soon we were off the app and in each others' spell.
                At the end of 2019 we moved in together, and after just a few months Covid-19 meant we were spending a lot more time together than we ever planned!
            </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Nono has me in stitches or giggles several times a day; he makes adulting together a blast"
                </blockquote>

            <p>
                Luckily, we got on like two peas in a pod and it wasn't long before we started dreaming of building a future together.
                Fast forward to today, and we are overjoyed to be celebrating our special day with you.
