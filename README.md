## The brief

- Create an HTML file called index.html . You may need to create other webpages, but this will be your homepage that acts as the landing page for your website.
- Create at least 2 other pages.
- Within the entirety of your site, you should have the following elements:
    - At least 5 images.
    - At least 3 font sizes (to help differentiate sections).
    - At least 2 external links (maybe to another website, or an email address).
    - At least 1 table.
    - At least 1 list (ordered or unordered, you can choose).
    - At least one submit button form (possibly to subscribe to a newsletter — don’t worry about the functionality of this yet).
    - At least one radio button form (e.g. you could ask a future subscriber what types of recipes they’d like to receive).
    - At least one quote/testimonial
    - At least 2 blocks (i.e text with a background).
- Within the entirety of your site, you should have the following JavaScript functionality:
    - Create a functional “Save for later” page for your website, where users can earmark articles, images, recipes, etc. in a personal folder to be able to go back and see them later.
    - Each item/recipe/image, etc. must have the option to “Save for later”.
    - When an item is added, an alert should tell the user how many items are in their “Save for later” folder.
    - Create a new HTML page for the “Save for later” section, which allows the user to see what is in their folder.
    - Create a form which allows a user to leave comments.
    - Create forms to allow a user to “like” an item/article/etc.
    - Create forms for if a person would like to contact you.
    - Within the entirety of your site, you should have at least the following jQuery functionality:
        - A function which contains hiding/showing.
        - A drop-down menu.
        - Animation effects.
        - A function with chained effects.
